- Let ghosts create moves further ahead which will add a delay in their
  tracking. This might result in an easier way to safely navigate for pacman.

- Add more / less areas with the rules:
  - ghosts movement speed decreases
  - ghosts are not allowed to move in a certain direction


data storage:
- retrieve average distance ghosts to pacman
